# Locatr
iOS app to save location
This app is used to save user location. I renamed the root folder on github from Assignment6 to Locatr for clarity. 

Known issues: memory managment needs work, the way I aligned the storyboard on the application makes stack memory keep going higher and higher.
In Android, I can manage it with intent flags.
This application has been tested on an iPad and iPhone 5S. 


It needs to import Parse framework to work correctly.
