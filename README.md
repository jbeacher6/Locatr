# Locatr
iOS app to save location
This app is used to save user location. I renamed the root folder on github from Assignment 6b to Locatr for clarity. 

Known issues: Stack memory managment needs work. The way I aligned the storyboard on the application makes stack memory keep going higher and higher with continuous use. 

This application has been tested on an iPad and iPhone 5S and needs to import Parse framework to work correctly.
