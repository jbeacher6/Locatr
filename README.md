# Locatr
iOS app to save location
This app is used to save user location. I renamed the root folder on github from Assignment 6b to Locatr for clarity. 

Known issues: Stack memory managment needs work. The way I aligned the storyboard on the application makes stack memory keep going higher and higher with continuous use. 
In Android, I can manage it with intent flags.
This application has been tested on an iPad and iPhone 5S. 


It needs to import Parse framework to work correctly.
